# About this app

This project is a ReactJS project that shows the weather in 4 cities: New York, SÃ£o Paulo, Rome and Tokyo. There are buttons with the flags that you can click to switch between them. When you click, the background changes according to the weather and if it's night or day. You can also check temperature in celsius.

This was developed from a tutorial for study purposes:
